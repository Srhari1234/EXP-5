# EXP-5
Aim:
     (a) To determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero. 
     (b) To determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using nested if-else statements. 
     (c) To perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input. 
     (d) To display the day of the week corresponding to a given number (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday).

Theory:

We learnt how to find the greatest number through if else statements, and even through nested if. We learnt how to use switch cases.

if else is a conditional statement used when there are conditions, for example if a number is greater than the other or if the user chooses one thing over another.

Nested if else is a part of those conditional statements however theyre one inside another to reduce the length of the code. It can be a bit complicated to understand though.

The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. if there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
